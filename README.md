# Data-Viz-with-IIP
As part of my weekly tasks during the workshop, I created graphs  using p5.Js with different concepts each week. <br />

## Week 1:Data Portrait

Challenge: You have made an alien friend from Mars. They are curious about your life. The catch is - they don't understand human text but do understand numbers, shapes, geometry, colors, symbols, and signs. Create a data portrait that helps your alien friend, understand some aspect of your life - (ex. friendship / music taste/ personality / 'habits / relationships / ambition).

<br />
I made a data portrait highlighting a few things about me along with a key for reading it.
