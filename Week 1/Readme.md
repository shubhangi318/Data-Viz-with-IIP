# Week 1:Data Portrait

Challenge: You have made an alien friend from Mars. They are curious about your life. The catch is - they don't understand human text but do understand numbers, shapes, geometry, colors, symbols, and signs. Create a data portrait that helps your alien friend, understand some aspect of your life - (ex. friendship / music taste/ personality / 'habits / relationships / ambition).

I based the emoji challenge on a "one-man army" character.
1. He was known for getting himself into the strangest of situations.
2. He usually tends to exhibit childish characteristics even though he is considered to be a 20-year-old adult. <br />

These two things resonate with me a lot :p
