Challenge: Use a city's live weather data (pollution/forecast/current) to create a p5js sketch.

I visualized the PM2.5 concentration level in four metropolitan cities:
1. Mumbai
2. Delhi
3. Hyderabad
4. Kolkata

This snap is taken on 22 August 2022, at 14:34 IST. The lungs change color depending on the current pollution in the city's air.
